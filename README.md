# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Updates to HTML
I have change the name of the title to reflect the name of the web site and the name of the agency to make the page optimised for search engines. 
I have updated divs in HTML file to the semantic HTM: elements, as per the original code hirecracy. 
I have added the the section ID for the Search engine optimisation, to fix the bug on the web page, where the hyperlink was not working. 

### Updates to CSS
I have moved sections to match the HTML semantic structure and hirecracy. 
I have compressed CSS code, by removing repeatitive lines and instead merging sections where there were the same atributes set for the multiple sections. 
I have changed some of the atributes to improve page accesibility and readability.
